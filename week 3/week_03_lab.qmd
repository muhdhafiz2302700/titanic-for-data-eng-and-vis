## Inner Join for one to one relationships
- If any key that appears in one table is equal to at most one key in the other table
- Each shareholder name in the shareholders corresponds to one company name in the traded companies table
- Only two companies appear in both tables so only two entries are created
- Joining company name
```{sql}
#| connection: con_investments
#| echo: FALSE

SELECT
    sh.sh_holder_id,
    sh.sh_holder_name,
    tc.comp_id
FROM shareholders AS sh
INNER JOIN traded_companies AS tc
    ON sh.sh_holder_name = tc.comp_name
ORDER BY sh.sh_holder_id;
```
## Inner Join for one to many relationships
- A one-to-many relationship between two tables x and y exists if keys in x match more than one key in y, but every key in y can match only up to one key in x
- Joining by company id.
```{sql}
#| connection: con_investments
#| echo: FALSE

SELECT
    tc.comp_name,
    tc.comp_id,
    pr.prod_name
FROM traded_companies AS tc
INNER JOIN products AS pr
    ON tc.comp_id = pr.comp_id
ORDER BY tc.comp_id;
```

## Inner Join for many to many relationships
- In a many-to-many relationship, at least one key in each table matches more than one key in the other table
- Joining by country.
```{sql}
#| connection: con_investments
#| echo: FALSE

SELECT
    sh.sh_holder_name,
    sh.country,
    tc.comp_name
FROM shareholders AS sh
INNER JOIN traded_companies AS tc
    ON sh.country = tc.country
ORDER BY sh.sh_holder_id, tc.comp_id;
```
