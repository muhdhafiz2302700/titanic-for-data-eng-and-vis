## What is the Titanic? {.smaller}
RMS Titanic was a British ocean liner that sank on 15 April 1912 after striking an iceberg on the ship's maiden voyage from Southampton, England to New York City, United States. Of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, approximately 1,500 died, making the incident the deadliest sinking of a single ship at the time.\
Titanic, operated by the White [Star Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Star_Line){target="_blank"}, carried some of the wealthiest people in the world, as well as hundreds of emigrants from the British Isles, Scandinavia, and elsewhere in Europe who were seeking a new life in the United States and Canada. \
The disaster drew public attention, spurred major changes in maritime safety regulations, and inspired a lasting legacy in popular culture. \

Anna Sofia Turja(https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-survivor/anna-sofia-turja.html (3rd-class passenger)

This quote raises the question: Were 1^st^-lass passengers more likely to survive than 3^rd^-class passengers? The data suggests that they were. The survival rate of 1^st^-class passengers was 62.04%, while the survival rate of 3^rd^-class passengers was only 25.53%. Crew members were even less likely to survive than 3^rd^-class passengers. The reason for this is that the crew members were responsible for ensuring the safety of the passengers and were therefore less likely to be able to save themselves in the event of an emergency. For passengers, the more luxurious the class, the more likely they were to survive, and the reason for this is that the 1^st^-class cabins were located closer to the lifeboats, making it easier for 1^st^-class passengers to reach them in time.
